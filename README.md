# Backend

The detection framework uses OpenCV and mediapipe, based on [https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/pose.html](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/pose.html).

## Configuration
First make sure there is Anaconda installed. Then run the following code to set up environment:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then switch to the newly created environment named `hnr23` by running:
```
conda activate hnr23
```
Now you are ready to run the code.
